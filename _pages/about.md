I am a final-year undergraduate student at the University of Melbourne, studying electronics engineering. I'm passionate about all things space-related, particularly to do with space avionics and communication.

I currently work at the [Melbourne Space Laboratory](https://melbournespace.research.unimelb.edu.au/), designing and testing the thermal control unit for Australia's upcoming lunar rover mission, the [Roo-ver](https://www.elo2.au/). The TCU is responsible for thermal sensing and control for the entire rover, to ensure it can function across the temperature extremes of the moon's surface. 

I previously have worked as an electronics engineer at [Esper Satellite Imagery](https://www.espersatellites.co/), where I was responsible for design, testing, and assembly of electrical systems onboard a hyperspectral imaging LEO payload, including the payload's onboard computer and wiring harness. 

As a longstanding member of the University of Melbourne's rocketry team [ARES](https://www.instagram.com/aresunimelb/?hl=en), I have contributed to many aspects of the team across a number of projects. I started in the avionics team where I was the sole designer of ARES' first flight computers for rocket control (with my flagship computer still in use by the team almost 3 years later, without revision). I then took over as avionics team lead, where I was responsible for managing a team of 10 electronics engineers and designing the overall architecture of the rocket's avionics system. Following this I was promoted to chief engineer of ARES, where I oversaw the design, manufacture, testing, and launch of ARES' most successful rocket to date at the Spaceport America Cup, Florence, which remains one of the most successful student-built rockets in Australia. 

After a stint as a propulsion member building a data aqcuisition and control cabinet for ARES' upcoming hybrid rocket engine campaign, I was again given a leadership position as the team's lead systems engineer. In this role I am overhauling the team's systems engineering practices, and implementing a requirements-driven model based on NASA's framework. This increase in rigour of systems engineering comes with ARES' ambitious goal to shift from commercially available solid rocket motors to constructing an entirely student built hybrid rocket engine, to be flown in a rocket at the 2027 International Rocket Engineering Competition.
