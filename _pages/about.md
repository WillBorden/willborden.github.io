Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a final-year undergraduate student at the University of Melbourne, studying electronics engineering. I'm passionate about all things space-related, particularly in the realm of space avionics and communications.

I currently work at the [Melbourne Space Laboratory](https://melbournespace.research.unimelb.edu.au/), designing and testing the thermal control unit for Australia's upcoming lunar rover mission, the [Roo-ver](https://www.elo2.au/). This unit is responsible for thermal sensing and control for the entire rover, to ensure it can function in the temperature extremes of the moon's surface. 

I previously have worked as an electronics engineer at [Esper Satellite Imagery](https://www.espersatellites.co/), where I was responsible for design, testing, and assembly of electrical systems onboard a hyperspectral imaging LEO payload. 

As a longstanding member of the University of Melbourne's rocketry team [ARES](https://www.instagram.com/aresunimelb/?hl=en), I have contributed to many aspects of the team's development and growth. Starting in the avionics team I was the sole designer of ARES' first flight computers for rocket control (with my flagship computer still in use by the team almost 3 years later, without revision). I progressed to the role of avionics team lead, where I was responsible for managing a team of 10 electronics engineers and designing the overall architecture of the team's entire avionics system. I was then promoted to chief engineer of ARES, where I oversaw the design, manufacturing, testing, and launch of ARES' most successful rocket to date, Florence, with remains one of the most successful student-built rockets in Australia. After a stint a propulsion member building a data aqcuisition and control cabinet for ARES' upcoming hybrid rocket engine campaign, I was again promoted to a leadership position as the team's lead systems engineer. In this role I am overhauling the team's systems engineering practices, and implementing a requirements-driven model based on NASA's framework. This increase in rigour of systems engineering comes with ARES' ambitious goal to shift from commercially available solid rocket motors to constructing an entirely student built hybrid rocket engine, to be flown in a rocket at the 2027 International Rocket Engineering Competition.
