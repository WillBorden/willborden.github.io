I am a final-year undergraduate student at the University of Melbourne, studying electronics engineering. I'm passionate about all things electronics and space related.

I currently work at the [Melbourne Space Laboratory](https://melbournespace.research.unimelb.edu.au/), designing and testing the thermal control unit for Australia's upcoming lunar rover mission, the [Roo-ver](https://www.elo2.au/). I previously have worked as an electronics engineer at [Esper Satellite Imagery](https://www.espersatellites.co/), where I was responsible for design, testing, and assembly of electrical systems onboard a hyperspectral imaging LEO payload, including the payload's onboard computer and wiring harness. 

As a longstanding member of the University of Melbourne's rocketry team [ARES](https://www.instagram.com/aresunimelb/?hl=en) I have contributed to many aspects of the team across a number of projects. From designing legacy flight computers as avionics lead, to being the technical lead for ARES' most successful rocket as chief engineer (placing 4th out of 152 teams at the [2024 SAC](https://www.soundingrocket.org/2024-sa-cup.html), one of Australia's most successful rockets at an international competition), to implementing industry-standard systems engineering practices as the team's lead systems engineer, I have gained strong experience in many aspects of rocketry and aerospace. 

I'm an avid tinkerer, and love to take on personal electronics projects in my spare time. I've designed my own eurorack modular synthesisers, built nixe-tube based clocks, and am currently engineering an entirely custom GNSS reciever.

Please check out the projects and cv tabs to learn more about my experience and interests, and please get in touch if you'd like to chat!
